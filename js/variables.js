// Project Descriptions
const projectDescription1 = "This application focuses on providing a simple and intuitive interface for managing daily tasks, "
+ "embracing a minimalist design philosophy to ensure ease of use and a clutter-free experience.";

const projectDescription2 = "Created a Chess AI using Python and Pygame, utilizing the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning "+
"for optimal move selection. Supports Player vs. AI mode, demonstrating strategic AI decision-making.";

const projectDescription3 = "This Machine Learning (ML) agent project uses computer vision, 3D ray perception sensors, and reinforcement " +
"learning to train an agent to navigate obstacles and reach a goal. The agents learns autonomously through trial and error, guided by incremental "
+ "rewards and penalties, within the Unity Game Engine and programmed in C# and Python.";

const projectDescription4 = "The Bodega Web Application is designed to provide services for both customers and CFOs (Cottage Food Operators). "
+ "CFOs will have the ability to create profiles to promote their businesses, allowing them to connect with customers who are interested in supporting "
+ "their local community. The goal of Bodega is to create a platform for CFOs to showcase their businesses and provide a gateway for promotion, as small, "
+ "home-operated businesses may not always receive the same level of visibility as larger, processed corporations. Bodega aims to bridge this gap and help CFOs "
+ "connect with potential customers.";

const projectDescription5 = "This product recommendation project aims to enhance the Amazon store page by scraping and filtering data to identify the "
+ "best-value products based on user reviews and price. Using R, the project builds a product recommendation system that employs a web crawler to collect data, "
+ "including product names, categories, prices, and reviews. The data is cleaned, sentiment analysis is performed, and a classification model is applied to "
+ "categorize products as 'best value' or 'not recommended."

const projectDescription6 = "Can Machine Learning assist with Predicting Stock Market prices? The problem of predicting how the stock market that often benchmarks"
+" the U.S. economy is an essential and significant question posed by many individuals, investment firms, and government institutions. This project uses the following "
+ "Machine Learning algorithms: Regression Trees, Extra Regression Trees, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network (Recurrent Neural Network) to train models and "
+ "outputting prediction of the S&P 500 index stock can be located by the stock ticker of '^GSPC' on the Yahoo! Finance website.";

const projectDescription7 = "The Literature-Film Hub is a web application I developed as part of my Advanced Web Engineering course for hosting and sharing reviews "
+ "of literature and films. Built using AngularJS for the frontend and ASP.NET for the backend, the application leverages an AWS RDS database for reliable data storage. "
+ "The development involved using JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL to create a robust platform. Users can create accounts, log in to write and post reviews, "
+ "search for books and films, and participate in discussions. The platform offers a seamless experience for literature and film enthusiasts to explore, review, "
+ "and engage with a community of like-minded individuals.";

const projectDescription8 = "In this project, I used the Unity Engine and C# to create and explore different lighting scenes, including Point Lights, Spot Lights, "
+ "Directional Lights, Area Lights, Emissive Materials, and Ambient Light. Through this work, I gained hands-on experience in selecting the right light type for "
+ "various scenarios, balancing creative vision with technical considerations like lightmapping and baked lighting. This project also deepened my understanding of "
+ "the differences between real-time and baked lighting, enhancing my ability to optimize visual quality and resource efficiency in static and dynamic scenes.";

const projectDescription9 = "This project, built using JavaScript and React, involved creating a tool to compare Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) through an "
+ "interactive UI. Users can build and visualize DFAs by dragging out nodes and creating connections between them, with the option to compare two separate DFAs "
+ "to check for equivalence. The project incorporates DFA minimization techniques to enhance the comparison process. This tool required careful attention to "
+ "UI/UX design and a deep understanding of automata theory, allowing users to explore and verify DFA behavior in a hands-on, intuitive manner. The project was "
+ "developed by myself and two student teammates for my Advanced Theory of Computation course.";

const projectDescription10 = "As part of a team, we developed an Android application in Android Studio that displays detailed dictionary information for selected words."
+ " Our focus was the frontend component, designed to seamlessly integrate with the backend, which retrieves data from an online dictionary API and presents key information, "
+ "including definitions, pronunciation, syllabication, and part of speech. It handles multiple definitions, manages exceptions, and considers API call limits and "
+ "language options. The interface ensures a seamless user experience by displaying dictionary information in a separate section without interrupting ongoing interactions, "
+ "with the display starting within 5 seconds. This project was a collaborative effort that demonstrated our ability to integrate external APIs and build responsive, "
+ "user-friendly applications.";

const projectDescription11 = "This project implements Rule 30 Cellular Automata with both sequential and parallel programming versions. The parallel version utilizes "
+ "MPI (Message Passing Interface) in C, demonstrating concepts learned in my Advanced Computer System Architecture course. The project explores the efficiency and "
+ "performance differences between sequential and parallel processing.";

const projectDescription12 = "Part of my research and thesis, this project is both 2D and 3D machine learning models to detect vehicles and classify vehicle types in 3D LiDAR"
+ " point cloud data. Applying 2D and 3D vehicle detection and classification models on real-time LiDAR point cloud traffic flow and output vehicle detection and "
+ "classification results, including vehicle types and coordinates.";
