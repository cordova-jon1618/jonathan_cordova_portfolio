const projectDescription1 = "This app provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing daily "
+ "tasks, with a minimalist design for ease of use and a clutter-free experience.";

const projectDescription2 = "Created a Chess AI using Python and Pygame, using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning "+
"for optimal move selection. Supports Player vs. AI mode, demonstrating strategic AI decision-making.";

const projectDescription3 = "This Machine Learning (ML) agent project uses computer vision, 3D ray perception sensors, and reinforcement " +
"learning to train an agent to navigate obstacles and reach a goal. The agents learns autonomously through trial and error, guided by incremental "
+ "rewards and penalties, within the Unity Game Engine and programmed in C# and Python.";

const projectDescription4 = "The Bodega Web Application is designed and built to provide services for customers and CFOs (Cottage Food Operators). "
+ "CFOs can create profiles to promote their businesses, allowing them to connect with customers interested in supporting their local community. "
+ "Bodega aims to create a platform for CFOs to showcase their businesses and provide a gateway for promotion, as small, "
+ "home-operated businesses. These home-operated businesses receive a low level of visibility compared to larger corporations. "
+ "Bodega aims to bridge this gap and help CFOs connect with potential customers.";

const projectDescription5 = "This product recommendation project aims to enhance the Amazon store page by scraping and filtering data to identify the "
+ "best-value products based on user reviews and prices. Using R, the project builds a product recommendation system that employs a web crawler to collect data, "
+ "including product names, categories, prices, and reviews. The data is cleaned, sentiment analysis is performed, and a classification model is applied to "
+ "categorize products as 'best value' or 'not recommended."

const projectDescription6 = "Can Machine Learning assist with Predicting Stock Market Prices? The problem of predicting how the stock market benchmarks"
+" the U.S. economy is an essential and significant question posed by many individuals, investment firms, and government institutions. This project uses the following "
+ "Machine Learning algorithms: Regression Trees, Extra Regression Trees, Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (Recurrent Neural Network) to train models and "
+ "outputting prediction of the S&P 500 index stock can be located by the stock ticker of '^GSPC' on the Yahoo! Finance website.";

const projectDescription7 = "I developed The Literature-Film Hub web application as part of my Advanced Web Engineering course. "
+ "It is designed for hosting and sharing reviews of literature and films. The frontend is built using AngularJS, while the backend is developed using ASP.NET. "
+ "The application uses an AWS RDS database for reliable data storage. The development process involved using JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQL to create a robust platform. "
+ "Users can create accounts, log in to write and post reviews, search for books and films, and participate in discussions. "
+ "This platform provides a seamless experience for literature and film enthusiasts to explore, review, and engage with a community of like-minded individuals. ";

const projectDescription8 = "In this project, I used the Unity Engine and C# to create and explore lighting scenes, including Point Lights, Spot Lights, "
+ "Directional Lights, Area Lights, Emissive Materials, and Ambient Light. Through this work, I gained hands-on experience selecting the right light type for "
+ "various scenarios and balancing creative vision with technical considerations like light mapping and baked lighting. This project also deepened my understanding of "
+ "the differences between real-time and baked lighting, enhancing my ability to optimize visual quality and resource efficiency in static and dynamic scenes.";

const projectDescription9 = "This project, built using JavaScript and React, involved creating a tool to compare Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) through an "
+ "interactive UI. Users can make and visualize DFAs by dragging out nodes and building connections between them, with the option to compare two separate DFAs "
+ "to check for equivalence. The project incorporates DFA minimization techniques to enhance the comparison process. This tool required careful attention to "
+ "UI/UX design and a deep understanding of automata theory, allowing users to explore and verify DFA behavior in a hands-on, intuitive manner. "
+ "I and two graduate colleagues developed the project for my Advanced Theory of Computation course. ";

const projectDescription10 = "As part of a team, we developed an Android application in Android Studio that displays detailed dictionary information for selected words."
+ " Our focus was the frontend component, designed to seamlessly integrate with the backend, which retrieves data from an online dictionary API and presents key information, "
+ "including definitions, pronunciation, syllabication, and part of speech. It handles multiple definitions, manages exceptions, and considers API call limits and "
+ "language options. The interface ensures a seamless user experience by displaying dictionary information in a separate section without interrupting ongoing interactions, "
+ "with the display starting within 5 seconds. This collaborative project demonstrated our ability to integrate external APIs and build responsive, user-friendly applications. ";

const projectDescription11 = "This project implements Rule 30 Cellular Automata with both sequential and parallel programming versions. The parallel version utilizes "
+ "MPI (Message Passing Interface) in C, demonstrating concepts learned in my Advanced Computer System Architecture course. The project explores the efficiency and "
+ "performance differences between sequential and parallel processing.";

const projectDescription12 = "As part of my research and thesis, this project uses 2D and 3D machine learning models to detect vehicles and classify vehicle types in 3D LiDAR point cloud data. "
